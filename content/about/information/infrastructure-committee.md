## Charter 

Forum ballot [FORUM-010-](https://cabforum.org/2019/10/08/ballot-forum-10-re-charter-forum-infrastructure-working-group/) reformed from the Forum Infrastructure Working Group (“FIWG”) to the Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee (FIS).

### Scope 

The authorized scope of the Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee shall be as follows:

- To oversee the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of the common CA/Browser Forum website and wiki resources;
- To coordinate updates to public and Forum-facing web and wiki content in support of the Forum Webmaster role established in the Bylaws;
- To create and manage the division of access and content spaces required to help ensure the separation of the work of various Working Groups and accompanying IP commitments, as described in the Forum’s IPR Policy;
- To manage the technical means of production of guidelines and other documents produced by the Forum’s subcommittees;
- To manage the Forum-level email lists and to offer management of working-group and subcommittee mailing lists as needed in support of the Forum List Manager role established in the Bylaws;
- To perform other activities ancillary to the primary activities listed above.

### End Date 

This Subcommittee shall continue until it is dissolved by a vote of the CA/B Forum.

### Deliverables

The Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee shall be responsible for delivering wiki and mailing list services to the Forum on an ongoing basis, and supplying access to these and to the management tools for these as is appropriate and required by the Forum. The subcommittee shall not propose any changes to the Bylaws or IPR agreements itself: where issues with these are identified, they may be redirected to the Forum as a whole or to appropriate subcommittees or working groups for further consideration.

### Participation

Any member of the CAB Forum is eligible and may declare their participation in the Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee by requesting to be added to the mailing list.

### Chair

Jos Purvis shall be the initial Chair of the Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee. The Chair shall not have a fixed term, but the Subcommittee may change its Chair from time to time by consensus of the Members participating in the Subcommittee or by voting method chosen by the Members by consensus.

### Communication

Subcommittee communications and documents shall be posted on mailing-lists where the mail-archives are publicly accessible, and the Subcommittee shall publish minutes of its meetings to the Forum wiki.

### Effect of Forum Bylaws Amendment for Subcommittees

In the event the Forum Bylaws are amended to add or modify general rules governing Forum Subcommittees and how they operate (“General Rules”), the provisions of the General Rules shall take precedence over this charter.
